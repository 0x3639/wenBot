SwapDrop Snapshot Block hash (legacy network): 36777c4379c25ed56d624e8b7a004d82329fe1f7612763f20f5d2d92907efd2c\n\nThe legacy blockchain has probabilistic finality hence it needs a minimum of 101 confirmations to be part of the canonical chain.\n\nThe SwapDrop spork for the Public Incentivized Testnet network will activate at momentum height 720941 and it may take 5-6 hours for the swap process to become available for eveyone.
The swap process will remain open until the Public Incentivized Testnet period will end.
Also it is important to mention that the Plasma Points for the first swaps may take up to 48 hours to arrive in the syrius wallet.
"Another important mention is that once the SwapDrop spork is active on the Public Incentivized Testnet, all znn-bundles < v4.0.0 will be obsolete, so those running nodes (Sentinels, Pillars, etc) must upgrade to the latest version."
"Please wait for the SwapDrop Snapshot Block to be ported into the Public Incentivized Testnet. As I said earlier, this procedure will take several hours. \n\nAnd I also want to remind everyone that the Plasma Points for the early swaps will take up to 48 hours to be processed."
Yes
The SwapDrop period is open as long as the Public Incentivized Testnet is live
No need to rush
This SwapDrop is important because it uses the same mechanism to swap the funds to the Alphanet. We need to test it as a community to make sure everything is OK.
It is also incentivized so more reasons to help discovering bugs or other issues
Very good point. Stay vigilant.
You will need to wait up to 48 hours for the Plasma Points to arrive.
"Just to be clear, the ZenonCore v1.6.5 only provides a way to export the swap wallet in order to be compatible with syrius. All balances from the legacy network at the SwapDrop Snapshot Block can participate in the SwapDrop event."
Did you check the legacy balance at the SwapDrop Snapshot Block? Plasma Points may take up to ~40 hours to appear in your account if the swap procedure is successful.
"We want to improve the swap procedure, so the community feedback is very important. If you have feedback regarding the swap procedure, please dm me or @SigliZNN"
Yes.
"The next major release for the Public Incentivized Testnet is very close.\n\nCountless improvements, bugfixes, a new deployment tool and many more surprises."
The SDK will also be updated for WarpDrive participants
The network upgrade v5.0.0 is now complete
Only PPs were ported and the faucet now gives 15k tZNN and 150k tQSR per request
Also Legacy Pillars must swap again in order to register as Genesis Pillars
"Those who participated in the SwapDrop and swapped their assets will not be able to swap again now to get tZNN/tQSR. \n\nIf you need tZNN/tQSR, please use the faucet."
You can go and update syrius wallet to v5.0.0 or use the updated bundles + the new znn-controller to spawn nodes on the network
The updated SDK will be available in the following days.\n\nSyrius bugs are being fixed. All feedback is welcomed as usual.\n\nThe network is stable and running smooth. Hope you enjoy the new znn-controller to spawn nodes on the network.
Alphanet Inception 19th of  November\n\nMake sure your Pillars are active for the Legacy Snapshot Block 1395395
~1 million sats would be necessary to cover the tx fees
Every donation from the community is appreciated.\n\nThe funds will be burned.
Yes. Taproot 48 blocks away.
"Not much, just to cover the tx fees."
Indeed.
Doesn't matter. Unused sats will be burned.
Yes. The community decides.
Thank you for your generosity @DogwithStyle
"No, ~1000000 sats is enough to cover the fees"
Thank you for all donations & your generosity
Great news: Taproot successfully activated.
Thank you to all community members for making this possible.
"""If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry."""
Congratulations to everyone that participated into the Zenon Public Incentivized Testnet.\n\nAll $PP will be distributed as $QSR at Alphanet launch (reminder: 1000 PP = 1 QSR).
"All Genesis Pillars are eligible for Alphanet Big Bang. Thank you for supporting the network. New instructions will be available soon.\n\nThe community is the most important part of a decentralized project. Thank you for all the feedback.\n\nThe next event is the Final Legacy Snapshot Block height 1405000. Remember: not your keys, not your coins."
The wZNN smart contract on Binance Smart Chain has been hacked.\n\nWe are doing everything we can to mitigate the issue.

There is more code to be unveiled.\n\nSyrius v0.0.1-alphanet wallet will be available for Windows and MacOS.
Syrius v0.0.1-alphanet is now live:\n\nhttps://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/releases/latest
Pillar deployment tutorial:\n\nhttps://github.com/zenon-network/znn-bundle/blob/master/PILLARS.md
Syrius .dmg MacOS should work now. You can re-download and check.
You can also setup your own znnd node as backend for the wallet.\n\nBuild go-zenon from source and start znnd. \n\nGo to Node management and select ws://127.0.0.1:35998\n\nRun your own full node.
"I encourage the community to setup other seeders.\n\nBut make sure you're connecting via a secure channel (in this case, wss - secure websockets)."
Great. Also add a load balancer in front.
Very good.
You can try and run znnd on a Raspberry Pi.
"All code will be open source, including Syrius and other repos.\n\nThe community can design a framework on how to propose, vote and implement new features/protocol upgrades similar to BIPs."
I think the best outcome for Syrius is to incorporate the full node like BitcoinCore wallet.
"Yes, v0.0.2 release is close. After that the code will be public and this should be a top priority for the wallet."
Unfortunately multi-process is harder to achieve. For example Google made this impossible for Android since 10
Yes.
Use a remote node until the sync finishes.\n\nAnyway I think recursive ZK-SNARKS/STARKS can solve some issues.
"Only one connection per wallet, so one handshake"
"The tech is promising, but should be implemented for light nodes first imo"
Another thing to consider is the initial peer discovery mechanism.\n\nBitcoin uses community hardcoded seeders (check chainparams.cpp)\n\nIs there a better solution?
"Bitcoin uses domain names (eg seed.bitcoin.sipa.be.), but DNS is a centralized system at the moment."
There are some options
bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=691.msg8922#msg8922
"I want to mention a couple of things:\n\n- Pillars should not serve clients; they should stay behind several full nodes in a sentry based network topology\n- ZIPs should be about tech and code, not about politics"
Yes
"It would be nice if Pillar operators can make a step-by-step tutorial (+ scripts/maybe integrate this into znn-controller) for a sentry based topology to protect the network backbone. \n\nWorking hard on bug fixes for both znnd and syrius. We are aware of all issues, thank you for your feedback.\n\nAll full node runners should prepare for the first network upgrade."
How is the sentry network configuration setup for Pillars going?\n\nHopefully it will be available before the upcoming network upgrade.\n\nPlease note that Pillars will be required to initiate the network upgrade. All full nodes will also need to upgrade to the latest version.
Thank you
The update isn't ready yet.
But the setup is important for Pillars.
Better prepare now
Prepare for possible attack vectors
That's why we're part of a community
Check the config file
Yes
Great.
Yes
The deadline was extended until the end of the year
"znnd node v0.0.2 is now available for download:\n\nhttps://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/releases/latest\n\n+ implemented a dual layer asymmetric cache: dramatically reduced memory usage; now it is possible to run the node on low end hardware and support network decentralization\n+ simpler setup: the genesis and peers are now embedded into the codebase\n+ more target architectures are now supported, including Apple Silicon"
Everyone should download and run a full node
Bonus points for making a tutorial on how to run znnd on a Raspberry Pi
Now it consistently uses under 3Gb of RAM. More improvements are on the way.
Yes. But for the moment I recommend higher specs to run the Pillar node.
The processing of momentums can be further improved.\n\nIBD is a very important topic for network decentralization.
v0.0.2 is an important milestone because more users are now able to run their own nodes without additional setup
Next Syrius release will feature the embedded node so everyone will be part of the network
Will be released soon
"Good news, all 3rd parties already performed the swap."
Now they need to complete the node integration. We're also preparing a new znnd release.
znnd v0.0.3 will feature the first Alphanet spork upgrade:\n- Accelerator-Z\n- fix the Plasma collect issue (enable the possibility to collect rewards via PoW)\n\nWhat do you think is a reasonable activation period for the spork?
It will also contain bug fixes and performance improvements. Pillars are required to upgrade to this new version in the first place.
They still need to integrate znnd in order to enable Alphanet withdrawals
There is no ETA for this at the moment.
Good suggestion. 2 or 3 weeks I think is enough for everyone to perform the update
Syrius v0.0.2 is also very close
No
Problems to think about in the long term:\n- IBD or ILD (Initial Ledger Download)\n- (dual)-ledger growth\n- tx processing time (embedded VM)\n- p2p improvements
Bridge Q1
I wouldn't call them compromises.. maybe trade-offs. I'm sure the codebase will evolve as more coders will join. Just look at Bitcoin now. And I also think more client implementations are needed. Rust is a very good candidate for an alternative go-zenon based node.
It's embedded at protocol level.
"Yes. Satoshi believed only in C/C++: that's why bitcoin has only one reference implementation. But programming languages evolve.. compilers, runtimes, you need to think 10 years into the future."
Hopefully everyone will work as hard once Accelerator-Z is live.
Another external VM can be integrated in order to facilitate user based smart contracts. I recommend WASM. Also don't forget unikernels.
"""Success is not measured by what you accomplish, but by the opposition you have encountered, and the courage with which you have maintained the struggle against overwhelming odds."""
"We need to port the SDK to Javascript/Python.. maybe someone can do a PoC/MVP implementation before Accelerator-Z is live. Very important to cover most used programming languages, so people will have a foundation to start building"
The current binaries are compiled with latest Go (v17.6)
Good
"The bridge is currently in testing mode. Until the official announcement, only advanced users should try it."
Not yet. It will be available in the next release.
ZNN Dart SDK incentivized version should be replaced with Alphanet v0.0.1 on pub.dev\n\nDart SDK v0.0.2 is on its way
Will be open source in the near future. The embedded node is in the final testing stage.
What MacOS version do you use?
amd64 or arm64?
Please fuse some QSR for the bridge address. You can find it in Syrius -> Info tab -> About -> scroll down to ZNN bridge address
"The community can build anything on top of a stable foundation. The embedded smart contract layer (native Go) is very powerful & modular and can support multiple VMs/runtimes, for example a custom zWASM (WebAssembly runtime). Unikernels can also be integrated at either protocol level or on top of a custom runtime.\n\nThe team is already part of this amazing community and working hard at delivering the best possible outcome. I'm sure that more devs will join once Accelerator-Z is live."
"The mentality should change from ""wen whitepaper"" ""wen alphanet"" ""wen code"" ""wen bridge"" ""wen *everything*"" to ""How can I participate and deliver value for the ecosystem?"". With Accelerator-Z will provide not only funding, but also a framework to deliver value for the entire ecosystem."
"Great question. The embedded smart contracts layer is designed to support multiple VM/runtimes.\n\nFor example someone wants to integrate EVM (I'm not a fan and don't recommend it) in order to support Solidity smart contracts.\n\nOthers can integrate a WASM runtime for smart contracts (I recommend this) like Polkadot/Cosmos.\n\nWe didn't want to impose a specific VM/runtime, the community should embrace a de-facto for smart contracts (hopefully WebAssembly)."
No. Development NEVER ceases.
I recommend a TSS scheme.
Schnorr is great for scriptless scripts (atomic swaps with Bitcoin).
What application do you have in mind?
"Suppose we'll integrate Solana VM/runtime for smart contracts. Do you know what happens next?\n\nYou don't, because you didn't study the trade-offs for each particular runtime."
Do you want a network that goes offline every other month? And it's about consensus and other things that are more complex to explain.
Do you know what syrius v0.0.3 will have?
What other node can you integrate beside znnd?
For a HTLC you'll need timelocks + hashlocks => znn x btc atomic swaps
For hashlock you'll need the same cryptographic hash function as Bitcoin
Decred & Litecoin had the first atomic swap implementation
In order to support any hash function/signature scheme/extra feature (depends) the code needs to be updated. After that a spork needs to be peformed (like a Bitcoin soft fork).\n\nThe first spork will happen to integrate and enable Accelerator-Z.
"Yes, exciting times ahead."
Any other questions? Need to get back to work
Thank you for your feedback. Very important for the next update.
Sounds good
We have 2 or 3 weeks for the spork activation. After znnd v0.0.3 is released
We can decide the spork activation period.. I think 3 weeks are more than enough
"First Syrius v0.0.3, after that znnd v0.0.3 and the spork period starts + 2 or 3 weeks and Accelerator-Z will be operational"
In the meanwhile teams can start designing cross-chain bridges for Hyperspace
Syrius v0.0.3 will have the (znnd) embedded node
The idea of integrating btcd is to provide interoperability by having access to the state of Bitcoin's blockchain
Multi-chain wallet != interoperability
All I can say is that there are 3 different solutions at the moment that can be implemented
/we_are_all_satoshi
I support this message
Bitcoin Portal is taken afaik
ZNNxBTC Portal
You can decide the name
I mean the community will decide the name... I agree that bridges have a bad reputation.
Embedded znnd == znnd with minor changes to be compatible with Syrius\n\ngo-zenon is and will remain open-source software\n\nSyrius is an interface for znnd. It will be open sourced after Accelerator-Z is online.
90% of the code used in production is open source now
I'm already running znnd without any issues on a flagship phone
Yes. But first let's move on with the network upgrade for Accelerator-Z
You have (znnd) logs
"Syrius v0.0.3 (embedded node) for MacOS is now stable. It is only available for x86_64. On M1, the node is emulated via Rosseta. I recommend running a native znnd ARM64 build for Apple Silicon."
Please download it again and reinstall. It was updated in the meanwhile.
"The wallet code is not mission critical, that's why it was delayed. Also Accelerator-Z integration is in testing stage right now."
"No, the first step was znnd integration and it was successfully accomplished."
More performance improvements are on the way
Yes and you have all the tools to do that.
"We need a diverse set of SDKs, especially Javascript/Typescript"
Why do you need a full node?
"Who can help with this? Python, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++ also needed"
It's normal. Wait for it to connect to the peers.
Download again Syrius from Github and reinstall it. All problems are fixed now.
The priorities are Hyperspace (focused on porting SDKs and building decentralized cross-chain bridge alternatives) and Accelerator-Z launch.
Let's see if someone can pull it off before Accelerator-Z is live on mainnet.
We're aware of the issue. The problem will be fixed.
Definitely.
Was already covered in some Medium articles.
The codebase is Dart (Flutter). Pretty straightforward to make it compatible with Android and iOS once the code is public.
This issue is already fixed in the upcoming release. Now we're also fixing some p2p issues.
This will require a protocol upgrade. It can be done after Accelerator-Z is live.
The NFT standard will be under the umbrella of ZTS. You can help by extracting the main ideas and outlining the benefits/trade-offs
Not yet. The embedded full nodes have private IPs. We need more public IP nodes. Recently we've made excellent progress on the p2p layer and this will improve both connectivity and IBD.
"Yes, if you're running the node with a public IP"
It depends. A bridge is just one possibility.
Sentinel nodes is the answer. How can you ensure they are running a full node with a public IP?
Any ideas?
A clever solution is needed. We have one already. But we're open for suggestions.
I think this should not be centralized. There are capable community members that can help.
"Atomic swaps, DLCs"
You can build more than you think using primitives like scriptless scripts (now that we have Taproot)
The tech is straightforward. The devil is in the details.
Merge mining.. Can we recycle PoW? Plasma..
Afaik Decred and Litecoin had the first cross-chain atomic swap\n\nThe state of the art is the Hash Time-lock Contract (BTC/LN leverages HTLCs for routing off-chain payments).
Great news. Just in time for Hyperspace.
"Won't work. There are some issues in Syrius v0.0.3 that we've already fixed. A new release is on the way. We've also upgraded the embedded node, so it will sync faster"
Please wait for the release. The AcceleratorZ spork is live on mainnet. More info coming soon.
The distribution of funds is 100% decentralized
Keep up the good work
You can borrow more stuff from the next go-zenon release
"As a suggestion, you can also add gomobile compatibility for the Go SDK"
https://git.xx.network/elixxir/client
"""The xx client is designed to be used as a go library (and by extension a c library).\n\nSupport is also present for go mobile to build Android and iOS libraries. We bind all exported symbols from the bindings package for use on mobile platforms"""
We use a similar approach (C lib) for the embedded node.
It would be a great submission for Accelerator-Z
Or integrate Zenon into it
All bugs are being fixed: embedded node bugs and sync issues.
"Working around the clock for go-zenon, too. Lots of bug fixes and performance improvements."
Someone noticed that A-Z spork is live on mainnet.\n\nEveryone should prepare for the next go-zenon/znnd release.
It will be the most important release since Alphanet inception.
Network upgrades will follow Bitcoin's softfork consensus - in NoM's case sporks
The community decided 3 weeks
Everyone must upgrade
Yes.
And yes.
https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/blob/aee7ab6e0874b91b29c72226f5da8cfb83218449/vm/embedded/implementation/spork.go#L131
We need to make sure everyone is running the latest Syrius (embedded node version)/znnd. The purpose is to have a successful spork activation.
Yes. And everyone is invited to apply to Hyperspace and build interoperability solutions.
Not yet. We're preparing a Syrius release in the coming days
Sounds like a plan. \n\nA public devnet for Hyperspace is needed. We'll support it.
Always.
"Syrius v0.0.4 is in the testing phase. The source code will be open source soon after deployment.\n\nIn the meantime, please re-download Syrius v0.0.3 if you encountered wallet related issues. It contains the latest version of the embedded node and several bug fixes."
No. Just change netid. Look at the About widget in Syrius.
We need to finish the go-zenon release in the first place.
Yes. We'll need to change only the prefix.
Syrius v0.0.3 has embedded node v0.0.3 that was not released yet (go-zenon)\n\nznnd v0.0.3 will be released in the following days\n\nSyrius v0.0.4 will have Accelerator-Z integrated and embedded node v0.0.3 (same as Syrius v0.0.3)
"No, it's the same thing. \n\nznnd is the node binary\nembedded node is the node library (libznn)\n\nYou'll see in the Makefile."
The problem is from Go 1.18. False positive
Also znnd v0.0.3 is out. Syrius v0.0.3 already has the embedded node (libznn-0.0.3).\n\nPlease upgrade your nodes and prepare for A-Z and Hyperspace.\n\nDownload link: https://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/releases
I also want to propose a no-fud zone starting today. Some accounts (including clones) are constantly spreading fud and disinformation that can severly damage the project in the future.\n\nI believe this community will step up and do the right thing: ban and isolate the members that are spreading fud.\n\nConstructive criticism is always welcomed. But spreading fud is disastrous and shoudn't be tolerated under any circumstances. I hope this will apply for every community channel.
Don't forget that we're entering a stage where more people will join this community.
Great.
What matters is building and supporting proactive community members. Everything else is nonsense that delays or destroys.
Can someone compare sync times between znnd v0.0.2 and v0.0.3?
Especially arm64 version (M1 version)
Perfect. Thank you.
Let's also see the differences on a raspberry pi 4
Working on more performance improvements for future releases
Zenon Network is an independent entity. Unofficial partnerships or any associations with other projects are just speculations. This is a very clear statement that was repeated over again. Trying to make imaginary links to other entities or projects is called misinformation. Spreading misinformation is worse.
This should be the new mentality
More optimizations are needed.
Yes. What suggestions do you have?
"Working on znn-controller, so everyone will be able to upgrade their nodes to v0.0.3"
We're one step ahead in this direction. Nodes with public IPs are already integrated.
Yes. Ideally we need a mechanism for auto peer discovery without relying on trusted third parties.
"â€œI anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where itâ€™s not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.â€"
I think there are more than 100K Bitcoin full nodes right now...
https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
Lightweight nodes are enough for typical usage (BTC/LN)
We need to scan only the znnd nodes
That's why we do a mass scan.
We need redundancy (config + mass scan + DNS + other options)
Sounds good. Can you make a proof of concept? You can compare the results to the default seeder list in go-zenon repo.
Happy NoM day everyone!
New repos incoming.
Syrius codebase is pretty huge.
Today we celebrate.
We're also preparing new features for go-zenon for enhanced security.
And preparing Syrius for mobile compatibility.
Hyperspace will cover this.
"""I think it would be possible for BitDNS to be a completely separate network and separate block chain, yet share CPU power with Bitcoin.  The only overlap is to make it so miners can search for proof-of-work for both networks simultaneously.\n\nThe networks wouldn't need any coordination.  Miners would subscribe to both networks in parallel.  They would scan SHA such that if they get a hit, they potentially solve both at once.  A solution may be for just one of the networks if one network has a lower difficulty.\n\nI think an external miner could call getwork on both programs and combine the work.  Maybe call Bitcoin, get work from it, hand it to BitDNS getwork to combine into a combined work.\n\nInstead of fragmentation, networks share and augment each other's total CPU power.  This would solve the problem that if there are multiple networks, they are a danger to each other if the available CPU power gangs up on one.  Instead, all networks in the world would share combined CPU power, increasing the total strength.  It would make it easier for small networks to get started by tapping into a ready base of miners."""
"""The incentive is to get the rewards from the extra side chains also for the same work."""
"""If you're still worried about it, it's cryptographically possible to make a risk free trade. Â The two parties would set up transactions on both sides such that when they both sign the transactions, the second signer's signature triggers the release of both. Â The second signer can't release one without releasing the other."""
We can do better: scripless scripts now (Taproot).
Exactly.
"""Avoiding CPU power fragmentation is no longer a reason. Â Independent networks/chains can share CPU power without sharing much else"""
Interoperability with Bitcoin can go beyond value transfer. Every detail must be taken into account.
Great.
We can recycle Plasma generation via PoW for example. Or the other way around.
You need to compute a PoW link in order to generate Plasma required by transactions on NoM. It may be possible to use the PoW links to merge mine Bitcoin; the other way around is to merge mine ZNN and create Plasma for Bitcoin feeless txs.
"Now back to work, we need to ship code and make new releases."
Wish you a speedy recovery
"Can you please download znnd from Github? The ""too many open files"" error was fixed in v0.0.3\n\nI suppose the node is not a Pillar/you don't have other nodes/clients connected to it"
Yes. This is how it works.
The embedded node is a full node. You just need to keep the wallet open.
"You don't understand the purpose of this project. Nobody is forced to stay in this community. If you can contribute, please do so. If you cannot, please let others do the work."
You try really hard to make imaginary connections. Fudding is easy. Contributing is harder.
Yes
"No. You can either use the embedded node or znnd connected to Syrius. Please note that znnd is native arm64 for M1. The embedded node is x86_64, so it will be emulated via Rosseta on Apple Silicon."
No.
Anyone can apply to A-Z and build.
Yes.
This is a very complex project. It is evolving every day. The idea is to have a solid foundation so everyone can become a contributor.
We have limited bandwidth to build and deliver. That's why Accelerator-Z was created in the first place.
Everyone is invited to apply and contribute. It is up to them to decide if they want to build on a next generation dual-ledger network with feeless transactions.
It is our responsability to educate them about the potential of this network.
btc -> atomic swap to zbtc -> (feeless transactions) zbtc -> atomic swap back to btc
"Yes, I understood that. Let me think."
You basically want to bypass btc fees if I get it right
"Yes, but off-chain payment networks like LN work by operating with locked btc with final settlements happening on-chain. They ""wrap"" btc by locking it in payment channels, thus avoiding on-chain fees."
"Yes, it is actually controlled by a ""smart contract"" (HTLC). The spending conditions are on-chain, while state updates happen off-chain."
"I'm aware, don't worry."
Not quite decentralized. But still good enough.
Pillars can act as TSS signers and hold native btc vaults.
Look. There are many paths to achieve Bitcoin interoperability. Hyperspace will support all these efforts.
I can help
Any updates?
Also the SDK ports should be a priority for builders.
Memory usage will gradually grow because the node will connect to more peers.
The public node will eventually connect to 60 peers
Public nodes have public IPs so peers can connect to them
You can use znnd or Syrius + Tor or VPN
What?
This was about the bootstrap for the p2p
As soon as Syrius code is open source. I can tell you the Linux version is nice.
Don't forget to add the port (35998 for websocket)
You can share it on public channels. Afaik it only works for MacOS. We didn't want to make a centralized setup.
You can fuse some QSR to generate Plasma for that address or wait until the spork activates on mainnet (April 8th).
Update znnd to v0.0.3 or later and Syrius v0.0.3 or later
I think we need more public nodes. We need them to sustain the network.
"Yes. If you see v0.0.3 or later, it's fine."
Because collecting rewards should be available with Plasma via PoW
No need to hurry. Thank you for helping out.
"""We are more fulfilled when we are involved in something bigger than ourselves"""
I agree.
"""A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990â€™s. I hope itâ€™s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time weâ€™re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system."""
That's why privacy preserving tech should be implemented at protocol layer + mandatory (unlike zcash)
Definitely.

The community will be able to do this after Hyperspace. We need some API endpoints for them.
For the moment circulating supply is enough. It would be great if you can supply the endpoint.
This won't be an issue after the spork is active
Perfect
Are you connected to the embedded node?
You can reconnect to your Pillar and check again
What problems do you have?
The community will make the interface in Syrius. The NFT standard will be implemented at protocol level.

znn-controller v0.0.3 is live\n\nhttps://github.com/zenon-network/znn_controller_dart/releases
Here is a one liner to update your Pillars and full nodes
wget https://github.com/zenon-network/znn_controller_dart/releases/download/v0.0.3-alphanet/znn-controller-linux-amd64.zip && unzip -o znn-controller-linux-amd64.zip
apt install wget unzip -y
And pick option 1) Deploy
Orbital will fund Hyperspace when A-Z starts
No. That option was removed as it was necessary only for the Alphanet migration process.
Everyone should update their nodes to v0.0.3 as soon as possible. \n\nOnly ~30% of active nodes are currently running znnd v0.0.3
Not enough public nodes at the moment.
https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/releases/latest
Everyone. znnd v0.0.3 & Syrius v0.0.3 or later
This will be an issue after a couple of years. But still it needs special attention. We have clever crypto for this anyway.
I think it's better to send them to the Github repo instead of the website
You just need to run a full node with a public IP
You can contribute and add IPC support.
It's not a priority right now. But IPC support can be added by the community.
Yes
Yes. Priorities for A-Z projects.
Hyperspace already has clear objectives.
You need to use http instead of https. Support for https in go-zenon can be funded during Hyperspace
"You need to connect to your local IP, not localhost. Check Syrius -> Info -> General -> Local IP"
~300 public nodes I think is a decent target right now
I see. More research is indeed necessary.
Can you remove the Website download section so I can pin it?
"You have valid points, but remember that Hyperspace focuses on general interoperability & SDK ports, while A-Z is open for a larger variety of projects ranging from VM integrations and node development to GameFi or even AI/IoT applications"
A-Z is the first step to expand the ecosystem. We have the foundation. It is time to build on top of it.
There are now more v0.0.3 nodes than every other version combined.. still a lot of v0.0.1 nodes ~50
I think the majority of Pillar operators already updated their nodes
We don't know. And this is very good.
Exactly. And we can only scan public nodes (there are ~150 online in total right now)
By default they are not discoverable.

"There are many optimizations that can be implemented, no worries"
Read again
Both. A minor bug with no security related implications.
"Yes, it will be delayed until everyone upgrades to znnd and Syrius v0.0.4"
A supermajority is safer for a smooth transition
It will be easier since everyone knows how to do it now
"The update is ready, but we'll need to cover more tests before releasing it"
The bug was caused by a security obsession in how the funds are being released..
So no worries.
When the release is ready. Can you prepare a nice post in the meanwhile?
Thank you.
This is caused by the auto-receiver. When you reopen Syrius the auto-receiver is restarted. Thank you for the feedback.
Keep up the good work.
Yes. I think a Bitcoin Core experience for the IBD can be implemented by the community during Hyperspace.
Also the IBD will need attention soon. Many optimizations can be implemented.
Blockspace is an important resource.
Can you share the logs with the memory leaks with me? Thank you.
znnd v0.0.4 is finally live on Github\n\nhttps://github.com/zenon-network/go-zenon/releases/latest
https://github.com/zenon-network/syrius/releases/latest
Syrius v0.0.4 is now live
Please update znnd and Syrius as soon as possible so AcceleratorZ will successfully activate
"Yes, znn-controller (option Deploy) is the fastest option to upgrade your Pillar to v0.0.4"
Yes. Small improvements in terms of user interface e.g. wallet version is now displayed in the Info tab.\n\nBut a huge improvement in terms of user experience: wake lock functionality implemented i.e. the embedded node will not stop during sync
Also znnd contains security improvements and I recommend upgrading znnd & Syrius to v0.0.4 as soon as possible.
Lots of bugs are now fixed. The memory for a public node (e.g. Pillar) will stay around ~6GB of RAM
Thank you @shazzamazzash
Check the pinned message.
What OS/specs do you have?
You'll need at least 8GB of RAM and a GPU to run Syrius.
Not enough because Syrius also starts the embedded node in the background.
Both. But more cores are better because of multi-threading.
"Because full nodes are first class citizens in NoM, more public nodes are required for the p2p network."
Definitely. I think payment integrations will be good for adoption.
During Phase 1 under ideal conditions. But we can get there; scalability in DLTs is mostly limited by physics and hardware.
Finality is another interesting topic. Deterministic finality is not good for decentralization.
"Here you talk about settlement, another interesting topic for probabilistic finality networks like Bitcoin."
This is the job of the p2p gossip protocol.
Fuse some QSR or wait for A-Z spork that fixes this issue.
Easy mode for Syrius can be done in A-Z
Tx -> full nodes -> Pillars processing txs -> consensus -> appended to the block-lattice\n\nSentinels are not implemented yet.\n\nPlasma is used as network gas and can be generated either by locking (fusing) QSR or by generating PoW (there is a hard limit for Plasma via PoW).
"A huge amount of work is already done, but still there are many things left. Hopefully A-Z will be a success and gather as many devs as possible."
Bitcoin is a success because many smart people are working on it. The community is the most important thing for a project. A community that supports proactive initiatives and welcomes constructive criticism.
Before A-Z so people can start implement it as soon as possible.
Smart contracts can be implemented by integrating a runtime/VM
There are many things that require development efforts. Hopefully A-Z will cover them all.
"Yes, the NFT standard will be under the umbrella of ZTS."
And a runtime/VM.
"And hardware wallet support, mobile wallets, SDK ports, atomic swaps, interoperability solutions, browser extension, znnd optimizations (IBD, tx processing, light node), enhanced p2p layer using libp2p, NFT standard implementation, unikernel integrations, etc"
And Hyperspace.
We are single threaded now. Just one core.\n\nWith A-Z and Hyperspace hopefully we'll be more like a GPU farm.
Nice concept.
The community is the only stewart of this project. Only the community can decide the fate of this project.
"Bitcoin was a scam in 2010, money for criminals in 2014, gamble money in 2017.\n\nNow it is becoming a world reserve currency & officially adopted by one country."
I agree. This project is in a continuous evolution.
https://obituariesbitcoin.com/
Satoshi achieved everything with nothing.
"""I'm sure that in 20 yearsÂ thereÂ will either be very largeÂ transactionÂ volumeÂ or noÂ volume."""
Apply to A-Z.
No. I'm part of the community.
Don't forget to upgrade to v0.0.4
Exactly. We are working around the clock for a surprise before A-Z launch.
Timelock functionality is already there - staking is one example of timelocked ZNN
Yes. And the hash lock is pretty easy to add. And you can do even better: use precompiled contracts like EVM for near instant execution time
>50% of public nodes are running v0.0.4
I don't know. But I guess the majority are running the latest version.
https://medium.com/fcats-blockchain-incubator/understanding-the-bitcoin-blockchain-header-a2b0db06b515
"""Version 1 started with the genesis block in 2009. Until September 2012, no meaningful signaling took place during this time."""
https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/asicboost/
Or others may take advantage of you.
This is a clear case.. every detail matters
This was powerful fud at the time
"Remember this.. the bigger you get, the greater the fud"
In the context of Bitcoin
But it applies to any project
AcceleratorZ is live on mainnet.
Also the surprise:\n\nhttps://github.com/zenon-network/syrius
Syrius source code is finally live on Github.
Yes.
No need to do this because you'll end up bloating the ledger. An activation model based on Pillar governance similar to Bitcoin's signalling process should be implemented (eg stage 1 signal protocol update stage 2 lock-in update stage 3 activate protocol update)
It's not normal. The embedded node hangs up sometimes and a restart is required. Further investigation is needed to fix this p2p issue.
It is designed to be slow. Everybody needs to come to consensus (95% threshold).
Yes.
Nice.
@shazzamazzash can you please update the pinned message? Maybe mention something about A-Z and some relevant community resources..
Yes. Very important to be decentralized. Would be a great candidate for Hyperspace.
Ok
Sounds good.
"A small step towards rusty-znn, a Rust based znnd node"
Multisig is the answer
It's not just the wallet. You are also running a full node.
You can pull the data from the ledger and display it in a separate app.
https://github.com/taurusgroup/frost-ed25519
"This variant is the one that is proposed for practical implementations, however it does not have a full security proof, unlike FROST-Interactive"
"If it's selected, yes."
You can read here:\n\nhttps://brink.dev/blog/2021/04/15/frost/
Too much overhead. It's already done off-chain.
I think having both is better
Nice
What OS do you use?
Next week.
Deterministic finality != decentralization
The main idea is to follow a ZIP (Zenon Improvement Proposal) process in the long term.\n\nBitcoin has well defined BIPs rather than a roadmap.
I think forwarding them to @SigliZNN first is a better idea.
"The community should pick a runtime that is suitable and a team should implement it via AZ.\n\nI suggested WASM, indeed."
"I'm sure everything will be built eventually. Some things are more complex than others, but everything is possible now because we have a solid foundation."
Rome wasn't built in a day.
I think Hyperspace is very clear in what should be achieved in the first 100 days of AZ.
"Yes. It's easier to audit, too."
Great. Thank you!
"You can use the PoW links implementation from go-zenon (pow folder)\n\nIt's about 2\n3 times slower than the C implementation, but it works"
I think the problem is reading the keyStore. Do you have multiple keyStores in the wallet folder?
Hello.
I really like all Hyperspace projects so far.
Wanted to say everyone is doing an amazing job!
We need the ZIP format to advance protocol upgrades
Always.
Great news!
Keep up the good work!
Low Pillar Majority (>67%)\n\nHigh Pillar Supermajority (>90%)\n\nHope it works in practice.
Yes. And I know you can deliver.
Looking forward for all A-Z teams to deliver and become part of the new HyperCore team.
Agree.
"HTLC is good, but PTLC is better"
We can have both.
"Instead of hashes, it uses adaptor signatures for locking"
Fungibility and less block space
We can leverage threshold encryption to disable MEV completely
Basically encrypt txs until they are included in a block to prevent MEV
You can check out SKALE network and see their implementation
The commmunity should focus on testing the interoperability projects from the Hyperspace Program: HTLC and the cross-chain bridge
Yes.
can someone compose a nice message to pin it about the interop projects?
The LP Program is still ongoing. More details will be released when Hyperspace teams will be ready for Alphanet deployment.
Hopefully @georgezgeorgez will finish the HTLC implementation so everybody will be able to test it with tBTC
"And I'm sure as soon as it's ready and tested, he can proceed and deliver PTLCs"
"Also the other interop solution looks very promising, as both Ethereum and Bitcoin have secp256k1"
"If it solves transaction pinning, it's ok imo"
"The block-lattice is just for mapping accounts. The ultimate decision is still ""made"" by the consensus protocol."
The dual-ledger has a very important property: separate consensus from other business logic
Will be fixed. Only the ZNN to wZNN direction will close on November 10th
Basically the hash lock is replaced by the adapter signature.
Let's first have this one in production and then proceed with PTLCs
And a nice hint: you can make the off-chain communication secure using X25519
This is one neat property of Ed25519 signature scheme
An embedded with Schnorr signatures to enable DLC for Sentinels would be nice.
Speaking of protocol-level oracles
And don't forget stratum-v2 and unikernels
"Accelerator-Z was designed to support all community related efforts including support, chat moderation, channel curation and so on.\n\n@SigliZNN is literally one of the pillars of this community, an invaluable member and a green ray of hope for everyone in darker times, devoted to this project since the very beginning of this entire journey.\n\nI've encouraged him to make proposals and proceed requesting monthly funds from AZ in order to sustain himself and continue delivering for this amazing community."
The Bridge functionality from Syrius should be put into maintenance mode.
"The ZNN -> wZNN is already deprecated, but some issues persisted unfortunately. All transactions will be cleared eventually, no worries."
Good idea. Also a good moment to acknowledge the hard work of several community members that are striving to integrate interoperability solutions into NoM. And last but not least all other community members that are dedicated to this project in various ways.
"From an architectural point of view, one of the best decisions so far was avoiding the implementation of a heavy VM at L1/on-chain. Do you know why?"
"It seems counter-intuitive, I know. But there is a technology that is superior from every perspective and should be the focus for HyperCore teams after the interoperability solutions are deployed."
And wanted to remind that PRs will be reviwed and merged. Keep up the good work!
It's a leaderless network.
Everyone over here is steering the project in the right direction.
Sentinels will come in Phase 1 and I'm sure their implementation will be top notch.
"After everything started during Hyperspace is shipped and deployed, including the interop solutions."
Community members that are interested should dive deep into zk-rollups and understand the crypto behind and how they (perfectly) fit into NoM.
"""A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what."""
Now we can apply the same principle to computation.
Exactly. This is the idea of a community driven project.
There are no core devs. Only community devs.
Same applies for Bitcoin. Everyone is just a contributor for a civilization value protocol.
"""Centralized third parties are security holes."" - this applies to everything and everyone"
It is a very strong requirement for a decentralized cryptocurrency.
Satoshi ignited the spark and only provided a direction.
"The cryptography wasn't ready for Bitcoin. It had pseudo-privacy, but not sufficient for the massive success that followed."
""">You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography.\n\nYes, but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.\n\nGovernments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own."""
PoW secures the block-lattice ledger by adding weight. This prevents some PoS attack vectors such as long range attacks.
And the PoW is performed by users that want to issue feeless transactions on the network: this increases the security margin when the network usage is higher.
The next challenge is to implement Dynamic Plasma (similar to Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment mechanism).
Sentinels won't need to compute PoW. Just process and relay information.
"The design architecture of NoM is actually brilliant: everything is taken into account and perfectly balanced to achieve the most of security, scalability and decentralization."
Interesting approach. Sentinels can also serve as protocol level oracles.
How many major Bitcoin mining pools do you know?
"Yes. L1 should be minimal, robust and as efficient as possible. I know we can do better. And we will."
This is an area overlooked by many. EVM at L1 is a deal breaker.
I encourage you to re-read the whitepaper. All the information is over there.
They are definitely not ornamental. They participate in the consensus and are properly incentivized to do so.
This is a good idea that can be implemented via TSS.
No
Not a good idea. Inactivity is punished by losing rewards.
Didn't know that.
Because the current implementation is not final as described in the whitepaper.
What I meant is that Sentinels can outsource the PoW generation to other sources.
"""The adjustment on 04 Feb took it up from 1.34 times last year's difficulty to 1.82 times more difficult than last year. Â That means you generate only 55% as many coins for the same amount of work.\n\nThe difficulty adjusts proportionally to the total effort across the network. Â If the number of nodes doubles, the difficulty will also double, returning the total generated to the target rate."""
First Bitcoin client was initially available on what OS?
"First it was released by Satoshi for Windows, then Linux and Laszlo ported it to MacOS"
"""The reason I didn't use protocol buffers or boost serialization is because they looked too complex to make absolutely airtight and secure.Â  Their code is too large to read and be sure that there's no way to form an input that would do something unexpected.\n\nI hate reinventing the wheel and only resorted to writing my own serialization routines reluctantly.""\n\nKeep it simple."
"""unsigned int is good until 2106. Â Surely the network will have to be totally revamped at least once by then.\n\nThere should not be any signed int. Â If you've found a signed int somewhere, please tell me (within the next 25 years please) and I'll change it to unsigned int"""
Thinking long term is key
"""Theymos already said this...  ECDSA does not support encrypting messages.  Only digital signatures."""
But we have Ed25519 and X25519
Food for thought
Actually every valid tx so far was processed.
Just a reminder that ZNN -> wZNN is deprecated and only wZNN -> ZNN is still live
There are still 4-5 stuck that require manual intervention. The idea is that every valid tx will eventually be processed.
BSC nodes are also highly unstable and frequently crash. The specs required just to run a full node are straight nonsense.
"@SigliZNN has done a fantastic work so far. I appreciate your initiative, but I think helping & supporting the HyperSpace interop teams to deliver their solutions will have a bigger impact in the mid and long term."
Raspberry Pi is the best candidate.\n\nIt should be able to sync & run without issues on a standard RBPi
"It was a very nasty bug that required too many hours to fix. Now it is patched.\n\nAnd as extra precaution measures, every tx was rescanned just to be sure everything is OK. That's why it took so much time.\n\nPlease remember that ZNN -> wZNN is deprecated and only the wZNN -> ZNN flow is still supported."
"I recommend everyone to swap wZNN to ZNN, as only ZNN is NoM native."
"We should transition smoothly towards a new decentralized bridge that is in the workings by HyperSpace teams.\n\nThe LP Program was also affected by this bug, but it is still ongoing."
The community should coordinate with HyperSpace teams to ensure a good experience for new members that want to participate in this ecosystem.
zk-telemetry. There are many ways to map the p2p network. But first we'll need to upgrade the p2p layer and using libp2p is a big step forward.
Yes.
Nothing changed since the last update.
Great. Now we need some automatic way to release binaries for the public.
"Great news. I'm confident you'll be able to overcome any issues, should they arise!"
I'm leaning towards incentivizing network decentralization at p2p layer.\n\nThe infrastructure that runs the code is very important.\n\nWe can start with small tasks such as integrating Tor into znnd and Syrius.
You can check if we can integrate them.
For p2p messages between network participants we can use\n https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal\n\nIt can be used to coordinate users that engage in atomic swaps.
The crypto is already there: Ed25519 & X25519
The whitepaper points out two sources of PoW: one CPU bound (ASIC resistant) and the other one ASIC friendly. The key is balacing them.
The design principles of NoM's architecture are very important in the long term development of the network.\n\nA simple and robust L1 with minimal features will always outperform over-engineered and complex designs that try to accomplish too many things at once.
The consensus is the most important part of a distributed network because it distributes trust in a set of untrusted peers that need to coordinate to achieve a common objective: maintaining the state of the ledger.
There are many flavors for different variants of consensus protocols and usually we want add to the mix Sybil-resistant algorithms such as PoS and PoW.
"PoW is the most pure form of Sybil-resistance. It was designed as anti-Sybil mechanism back in the '90s.\n\nPoS is a weaker anti-Sybil mechanism than PoW, but coupled with a classical consensus protocol makes it a very good candidate to Bitcoin's PoW."
"But pure PoS based consensus protocols are flawed from an economic/societal perspective that undermine decentralization and in some cases, certain security thresholds."
PoW evolved into two opposite flavors: ASIC-friendly and ASIC-resistant.\n\nBitcoin is ASIC-friendly because its sole purpose is to convert energy as efficient as possible.
But ASIC-resistant algos are important to keep participation as decentralized as possible.
1 CPU = 1 vote was just an assumption of Satoshi\n\nHal clearly envisioned a widespread Bitcoin adoption at industrial scale.
"So we have BFT consensus based on virtual voting (outlined in a paper in '93), PoS, (dual) PoW and now let's talk about the ledger structure."
The idea behind a dual ledger system is to decouple consensus from chain weight.\n\nThis is very important because consensus and chain weight are fundamental for a L1.
"Bitcoin has consensus coupled with chain weight: ""longest chain of most accumulated proof of work""."
NoM has consensus decoupled from chain weight (added when users are performing tx with PoW).
"None of top L1s are designed to take into account all those variables and are aiming to ""solve"" the scalability trilemma."
"Me neither, but you have to adapt whenever is possible.\n\nSatoshi couldn't imagine that the hardware itself will be molded to fit the SHA-256d algo."
Increased throughput and decentralization through participation.
"In other networks, users pay a fee to make transactions and usually miners are rewarded.\n\nIn NoM, users pay with Plasma (that usually involves PoW) to make transactions and by doing so, they add weight to the ledger, thus effectively securing it."
"And on top of this architecture, a dual-coin economy was designed to balance and encourage active participation at every level: you can literally start with nothing but your own skills and contribute via the on-chain Accelerator and be rewarded."
"The dual-coin economy also takes into account ""greedy staking"" and other ""the rich getting richer"" schemes and provides long-term sustainability for active network participants."
"Sorry, my mistake. But you get the idea."
And you need both: ASIC-friendly for security and ASIC-resistant for participation. I think it's safe to say SHA-256d and RandomX are the best candidates (reminder: we currently have SHA-3 as pow-links).
Increased thoughput via dynamic Plasma\n\nZK-proof rollups are part of the strategy to keep the L1 minimal and robust.
Bitcoin does exactly this: it is indeed minimal (non-Turing complete) and very robust.
Networks that implemented a heavy VM (EVM/WASM) at L1 will always be plagued by scalability issues in the long run.
"Unikernels can be implemented on top, as well as other ZK rollup solutions that will support Turing-complete smart contracts."
"There are a lot of things to do, but rest assured that you are building on a solid foundation with a long term vision."
The state of the rollup will be posted and verified on-chain.
"For the moment the network is capped, that's why dynamic Plasma is the next logical step for the HyperCore teams."
And all community members are encouraged to participate in those discussions.
"No, this is just an artificial limit. The network can process several times more with the current implementation."
But obviously we can do even better with the implementation outlined in the whitepaper. Coupled with 10-100x more using ZK rollups.
"The p2p layer needs attention, too.\n\nAnd ""27070"" won't happen again."
"I tried to help our community better understand the design principles behind NoM and why it's superior in many aspects, especially in terms of decentralization, scalability and security."
